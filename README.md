# data_challenge_ophthalmology
OVERVIEW: This was a data challenge -- to be completed within 40 hours -- composed of two aims based on the analysis of simulated patient data. These two aims are as follows: 
* <ins>Aim 1</ins>: Assess the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the prevalence of diabetes in a set of over 4,000 patients.
* <ins>Aim 2</ins>: Design a segmentation algorithm for segmenting retinal vasculature from ophthalmic images, using two sets of ground truth segmentations for evaluation.

All files and data associated with each aim are stored under the folders **Aim1** and **Aim2**, respectively. A summary of all analyses and key findings for both aims is presented in *Slavkova_Report_DataChallenge.pdf* in the main branch.
